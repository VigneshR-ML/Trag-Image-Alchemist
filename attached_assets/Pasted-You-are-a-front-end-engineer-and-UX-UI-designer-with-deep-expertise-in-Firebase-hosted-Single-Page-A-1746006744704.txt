You are a front-end engineer and UX/UI designer with deep expertise in Firebase-hosted Single-Page Applications. You write clean, modular HTML/CSS/JavaScript outlines, describe component behavior and animations in plain language, and ensure pixel-perfect, responsive layouts. You never output full code—only clear instructions, component trees, and styling guidelines.

User prompt (what to ask the assistant to build):
Hi! I need to improve my existing “remove background” editor feature while keeping all other features exactly as they are. Then I want a modern, responsive landing page (to be hosted on Firebase with Firebase Authentication) that includes:

Header

Logo at left, primary nav links (Home, Features, Pricing, Editor, Login) centered or right-aligned.

“Sign In” / “Sign Up” buttons styled consistently with our color palette.

Hero Section (above the fold)

Prominent heading, concise subheading, call-to-action button (“Get Started – It’s Free”) linking to signup.

Clean illustration or product screenshot on the right.

Subtle entrance animation (fade-in + slide up).

Features Overview

One row of three feature cards (including “Remove Background” as the first card, with a note: “New & improved!”)

Each card: icon on top, title, two-line description, and “Learn More” link.

Flip-card hover effect or gentle scale-up on hover.

Pricing Section

Two pricing cards side by side, equal width, with equal vertical rhythm:

Free Plan

Title: “Free”

Price: “$0 / month”

Benefits list: “5 credits per email ID”

Action button: “Start for Free”

Disabled after credits exhausted (grayed-out state + “Upgrade to Pro” link).

Pro Plan

Title: “Pro”

Price: “$0.50 / month”

Benefits list: “Unlimited background removals + all premium features”

Action button: “Subscribe Now”

Each card animates a gentle lift and shadow on hover.

Editor Page Layout

Flexible, two-column canvas:

Left pane: tool palette with icons for each editing feature (including improved “Remove Background”).

Right pane: live preview area, 100% width within pane, with draggable/resizable controls overlay.

Top toolbar: “Undo/Redo,” “Zoom In/Out,” “Save to Cloud” (Firebase).

Bottom status bar: file name, current zoom level, loading indicator.

Subtle UI animations:

Toolbar icons subtly pulse on hover.

Background-removal progress shows an animated spinner that morphs into a checkmark when done.

Draggable controls highlight when hovered.

Footer

Four columns:

Logo + short tagline.

Quick links: Home, Features, Pricing, Editor.

Resources: Help Center, Docs, Blog, Contact.

Social icons (Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn).

Legal notes at bottom: copyright + Terms & Privacy.

Global Requirements

Use exactly the existing color palette (do not change or add any colors).

Fully responsive: mobile (single column), tablet (two columns), desktop (four columns where applicable).

Font hierarchy: H1–H4 scale, body text at 16 px, buttons at 14 px.

Spacing and alignment: use 8 px baseline grid.

Accessibility: all interactive elements keyboard-focusable, alt text for images, sufficient contrast (as per existing palette).

Host on Firebase with Firebase Auth for login gating—after sign-up, users must verify their email before accessing editor features; throttle Free-plan credits via Cloud Functions.
